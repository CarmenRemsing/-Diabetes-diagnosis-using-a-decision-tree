# -Diabetes-diagnosis-using-a-decision-tree
This poject utilises the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 768 instances of females older that 21 years, and it has 8 diagnostic attributes. These features include medical predictors such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, and age.
The objective is to predict the target 'class' variable, where an outcome of 1 indicates a positive diabetes diagnosis. The core of the project involves building and training a Decision Tree Classifier. This moddel learns a series of hierarchical, interpretable rules based on the provided attributes (e.g.,'IF Glucose>120 and BMI>30 THEN predict DIABETES') to classify patients.
The process includes preparing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and training the tree to identify the most significant predictive patterns. The final goal is to produce a model that can accuratelly assess the risk of diabetes, providing a clear, visual and data-driven tool for medical analysis.
